> 📌 Note
>
> This repository contains a collection of old programs that I wrote during my early learning phase in programming.
>
> The code may include some minor mistakes or non-ideal practices, but it works and reflects my learning progress and understanding of programming concepts at that time.
>
> The purpose of this repository is to document my learning journey rather than to present polished, production-ready code.
